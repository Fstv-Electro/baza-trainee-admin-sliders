# baza-trainee-admin-sliders

## Code doesn't work in this repository - that all what I can show from project

  This is a stock project that is working today. The admin panel was written without CMS. This is a group solution for the development and understanding of future developers who come to this platform to practice, getting commercial experience without payment. https://baza-trainee.tech/en is a platform for people who have not yet found a job, but need experience and development of new technologies. First of all, all projects are written for people who need financial assistance in disseminating information, fundraising, and development. Everyone participates in projects: project manager, designers, testers, developers. You're the only one I've worked with.

  The admin panel displays all the slides that are on the main page. They can be added, edited, deleted. There is also a validation of the maximum number of slides, which makes the button disabled. There is a display of information on the slide depending on the language.

  Adding and editing slides have a preview for convenient checking of text and image placement. Added validation to the form. Custom inputs have a built-in click-to-click translation of Google Translate.
2 form buttons, send data and clear the form, if necessary.
